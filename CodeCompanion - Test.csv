Basics,Password Generator,"This project is a simple password generator that creates random, secure passwords based on user-specified criteria. It utilizes the Python secrets module for generating cryptographically strong random numbers and the string module for creating a character set.","1. Define the Character Set: Use the string module to include all ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.
2. Password Generation Function: Write a function to generate a single password of specified length by randomly selecting characters from the defined set.
3. User Interaction: Implement a loop to repeatedly ask the user for the number of passwords and their lengths, handling exceptions for non-integer inputs.
4. Generate and Display Passwords: For the number of passwords specified, generate each and print them out.",4,"import string

Basics,Random Name Generator,"This project involves creating a Python script that fetches a list of names from an online source and randomly selects a name from the list. It uses the requests library to download the data from a given URL, which contains a plain text file of proper names. The random library is then used to select a name at random from this list. This could be particularly useful for applications such as generating random usernames, test data, or for any use case where random name selection is needed.","1. Import Libraries:
Import the requests module to handle HTTP requests.
Import the random module to enable random selection from the list.
2. Fetch Data:
Use the requests.get() method to download the content from a predefined URL that points to a plain text file containing proper names.
3. Data Processing:
Process the fetched data by splitting the text into individual names using the split() method. This step removes any empty spaces and organizes the data into an iterable list of names.
4. Random Name Selection:
Utilize the random.choice() method to select and print a random name from the list of names. This function is directly used on the list obtained from the splitting operation to pick a name at random.",4,"def import_libraries():

Basics,Shorten Links,"This project is a simple Python script that utilizes the pyshorteners library to shorten URLs.

Import the pyshorteners module, which is used to interact with various URL shortening services.

Prompt the user to enter the URL they wish to shorten. This is done using the input() function to capture user input from the command line.
3. Shorten URL:
Initialize a Shortener object from the pyshorteners library.
Use the tinyurl service within pyshorteners to shorten the provided URL.
Store the shortened URL in a variable.
4. Display Result:
Print the shortened URL to the console, providing the user with the transformed link.

The script is designed to run interactively: once started, it will prompt for input, process that input to shorten the URL, and then display the result—all in a straightforward, linear sequence.",5,"def import_library():
